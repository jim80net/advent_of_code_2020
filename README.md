# advent_of_code_2020

My submissions for [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020/). 

The programs are written in [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) and [Clojure](https://clojure.org/) depending on my approach to the problem.

What I've noticed so far is that, if I'm interested in managing state, then Elixir's [GenServer](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/GenServer.html) module is excellent at offering intuitive layers to organize code in.

For data transformation, I find Clojure with its [syntax](https://clojure.org/about/lisp) and its 
[robust library of functions](https://clojure.github.io/clojure/clojure.core-api.html) 
let's me build programs that directly expresses the transformations I want to occur with minimal overhead.
